BY MARY-FRANCES HECK BON APPETIT APRIL 2013

YIELD: Makes 4 servings
ACTIVE TIME: 30 minutes
TOTAL TIME: 30 minutes
INGREDIENTS

2 tablespoons sliced almonds
8 ounces soba (Japanese-style noodles) or spaghettini
Kosher salt
1 teaspoon plus 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
12 ounces skirt or flank steak
Freshly ground black pepper
2 scallions, whites and greens separated, chopped
4 medium garlic cloves, chopped
1 tablespoon grated peeled ginger
2 heads baby bok choy, quartered
1 medium carrot, peeled, thinly sliced on a diagonal
3 tablespoons oyster sauce
3 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
3 tablespoons unseasoned rice vinegar
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
PREPARATION

Preheat oven to 350F. Spread out almonds on a small rimmed baking sheet; toast, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8-10 minutes. Let cool and set aside.

Cook noodles in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain; rinse to cool and set aside.

Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Season steak with salt and pepper and cook until charred in spots, about 4 minutes per side for medium-rare. Let rest 10 minutes. Thinly slice against the grain.

While steak rests, wipe out skillet and heat 3 tablespoons vegetable oil over medium heat. Add scallion whites, garlic, and ginger. Stir until softened, about 1 minute. Add bok choy and carrot. Cook, tossing occasionally, until crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.

Whisk oyster sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, sesame oil, and 1/2 cup water in a small bowl. Add to vegetables; bring to a simmer. Fold in scallion greens and reserved almonds and noodles. Serve steak with noodle stir-fry.
